    <h1>[eGPU OVER M2]</h1>
     <p>When you have an M.2 slot on your motherboard, it allows you to connect PCIe-based devices, such as NVMe Drives, directly to the motherboard. It also allows auxillary I/O devices to be added, such as GPUs.</p>
    <h1>[WHY A MINIPC]</h1>
     <p>In the case of choosing a MiniPC over a Desktop, a MiniPC is considerably more compact, portable, and energy-efficient, than that of a full size desktop of the same CPU chip. 
	There is the issue of wanting the same GPU, however, but this is easily solved with an eGPU.<br>
    In the case of a Laptop, the user looks at the usecase. Do they need the flexibility of a MiniPC and its I/O, or do they need the portability of a Laptop? Formfactor is the deciding factor. <br>
    I chose an HP ProDesk 400 G2 Mini PC. Many exist like it, but I only found the existence of its M2 NGFF port important. </p>

    <p>As the current CPU is 4C/4T, and only consumes 35w of power, its perfect as it sits for programming and media use, only requiring a display port cable to take advantage of the integrated graphics.
    But for anything heavy; such as gaming, rendering or running a portable AI, I would prefer to have a GPU.</p>
    <h1>[ADDING CONNECTION]</h1>
    <p>To add the EGPU, I stuck with an ADT-Link adapter, relying on external power to power the card, and an open space to plug the M2 into. As the design is mostly a direct to pin design, theres no worry of faulty microcontrollers if a less reputable source needs to be considered.
    Operation is simply plug and play, unscrewing the M2 retainment screw, plugging in the adapter, and putting the screw back in. All thats left is putting the GPU and Power Supply in.</p>
    <h1>[INCOMPLETE]</h1>
    <p>I'm going to add info about the GPU, the power supply, and performance later.</p>

    <h1>[SECTION TO BE EDITTED]</h1>
    <p>Every now and then, in online technical chat rooms I hang around in, someone pops in and says something in the lines of,
        "I wanted to use X to do Y. Is X a good product for Y?"
      10 percent of the time, this turns into that user rejecting any information that tells them that purchasing X is a bad decision, or that its not the best solution for what they are asking.
      What the person is actually asking here is,
        "Can you help encourage me to buy X?"

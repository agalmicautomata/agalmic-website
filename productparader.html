    <h1>[IGNORING THE CROWD]</h1>
    <p>  Every now and then, in online technical chat rooms I hang around in, someone pops in and says something in the lines of,</p>

    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
      <p class="message">
        "I wanted to use X to do Y. Is X a good product for Y?"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
      
      <p>  10 percent of the time, this turns into that user rejecting any information that tells them that purchasing X is a bad decision, or that its not the best solution for what they are asking.<br>
      They get combative and explain that its either just the way they want to do it, too expensive to do an alternative, or too complicated for them to do.

      When they do this, what the person is actually asking here is,
      </p>
    
      <blockquote>
        <span class="name">Foobar123:</span>
        <p class="message">
          "Can you help encourage me to buy X?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
    
      <p>  When this happens, it usually ends up annoying a majority of the people attempting to help, who are usually nice enough to keep their frustration to themselves.<br>
      Not only could they be using that time more efficienctly elsewhere, it makes it less likely that the person asking will get help in the future. No one wants to help a stubborn person.<br>
      Plus frankly, who wants to deal with someone who suddenly knows something is good enough when they just asked if it was?<br>
      </p>
      <p>  In summary,<br>
      // Don't ask about a solution or purchase if you're insistent on using that solution or purchase.<br>
      Otherwise, to make others not feel as if they're talking to a brick wall, do your part and be more receptive.<br>
